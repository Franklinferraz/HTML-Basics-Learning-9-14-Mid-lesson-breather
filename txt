Mid-lesson breather

You've done an awesome job! 
Here's a quick summary of things we've learned:

HTML is used to give websites structure.
We open HTML files using a browser, and the browser renders (shows us) the file.
HTML files have a <head> and a <body> (just like you!)
In the head, we have the <title> tags, and we use these to specify the webpage's name.
How to make headings and paragraphs.

Instructions
Add a title between the <title> tags.
Create a <h3> sized heading in the body.
Make your heading say anything you want! 
(Just don't forget to close it.)
Create three paragraphs using <p> tags and fill them with content
(e.g. about cars, your pet, favorite city to travel—whatever you like!)
